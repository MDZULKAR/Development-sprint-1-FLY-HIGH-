        <p>Paraphrasing is one of the most important things that you will learn at university. It is a skill that you are likely to use your whole life. Before we look at this skill in detail, it is worth considering paraphrases in relation to summaries and direct quotations.</p>

    <h5>Why paraphrase?</h5>

        <p>Using direct quotations is easy; anyone can do it! At times, direct quotations are important; there are some occasions when you need to refer to the author’s exact words, for example, if you would like to refer to a statement that is particularly famous, striking or succinct.</p>

        <p>However, quoting too much is a sign of bad writing. It indicates that you cannot write
well, you are lazy, or you do not have strong understanding of the material.</p>

        <p>Consider this: if you were a lecturer, would you be more impressed with a text full of points cut and pasted in the form of direct quotations? Or, would you prefer to see ideas and facts incorporated into the text in the forms of paraphrases and summaries which fit the general style of the student’s text, and indicate greater understanding and analysis?</p>

    <h5>When should you provide citations?</h5>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Every time you provide a direct quotation, you should provide an in-text citation and
a full reference in the reference list. Paraphrases and summaries are no different.
Provide citations every time you make use of facts or ideas found in another text. </li>
  <li>The only time in which you would paraphrase and not provide a citation is when
what you paraphrase can be considered widely known information that is in the
public domain. For example, you would not need to provide a citation if you were to
paraphrase this sentence: “Australia is a large country with a relatively low population
density”. That is widely recognised as common knowledge. </li>

  <li>You would, however, need to provide a citation if you were to paraphrase this:
“Australia’s estimated resident population at June 2003 was just under 19.9 million, an
increase of 1.2% over the previous year” (About-Australia.com.au, 2008).</li>

<li>The following sentence would need to be paraphrased, cited and commented upon:
“Holden’s brand-new VE Commodore is, without doubt, the best car Australia has ever
produced”.</li>

<li>An opinion or value judgement is present here. However, “The Holden Commodore
is a popular car in Australia.” is a sentence that would not need citing. However, it
would be wrong to think that there is a fixed rule about what you can NOT cite with
confidence. If you have any doubt, provide a citation. You will almost never be
accused of citing too much, but you may experience serious consequences if you cite
too little. </li>
</ul>
